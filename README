What is this?
==============================================================================

A small example of how to fetch data and present them with dygraph,
graphs are syncronized so when you zoom in on one graph the other
should zoom to the same location.



==============================================================================
How can I test this?
==============================================================================

$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer


 goto: http://127.0.0.1:8000

The REST API here is just hard coded, i.e. a regular web server that
recognizes .json and returns 'application/json' as its Content-Type,
should work with this example, but the part under:

    rest/*

needs to be replaced with an actual REST API that delivers JSON, as
expected, currently it is assumed that:

    GET  rest/load/from/X/to/Y/interval/M

returns the network and cpu load of cores from the time period
X to Y, at intervals [X, X+M, X+(2*M),.., Y] as a percentage of
capacity [0-100], like this:


[
 { "name": "Deployment component 1",
   "values":[[1, 20.3, 0.2],
             [2, 20.1, 0.6],
             [3, 10.1, 0.7],
             [4, 12.1, 1.7]]
  },
  { "name": "Deployment component 2",
    "values":[[1, 25.3, 0.2],
              [2, 16.1, 2.6],
              [3, 15.1, 1.7],
              [4, 12.1, 3.7]]
  },
      .
      .
      .

  { "name": "Deployment component N",
    "values":[[1, 25.3, 0.2],
              [2, 17.1, 7.6],
              [3, 17.1, 1.7],
              [4, 12.1, 3.7]]
  },
]


I.e. at interval 1 "Deployment component 2" has network load of 25.3 and
CPU load of 0.2 %, and so on..
